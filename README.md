#Introduction
Spam emails are a common nuisance that often clutter our inboxes and pose security risks. 
This project aims to develop a reliable and accurate email spam classifier to automatically filter out unwanted spam emails, allowing users to focus on important messages.

#Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing a collection of emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or ham. 
The dataset is obtained from a reliable source and serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the classifier model.

#Data Preprocessing
The raw email data undergoes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare it for analysis. 
This involves removing any unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and converting the text into a suitable format for feature extraction.

#Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a crucial step in the email spam classification process. 
Various techniques, such as bag-of-words representation, TF-IDF, or word embeddings, are employed to transform the textual data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand.

#Model Training
Different machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests, are trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the patterns and characteristics of spam and ham emails. 
The models are trained using a portion of the labeled dataset and are fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance.

#Model Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated on a separate portion of the dataset to assess their performance in classifying spam and ham emails. 
Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to measure the effectiveness of the models.

#Usage
To use the email spam classifier, follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation. 
This includes steps for installing any required dependencies, preprocessing the data, training the model, and using the classifier to classify new email messages.
